# Introduction

This `README` is a summary of responses to questionnaire on annotation platforms (from https://forms.gle/iZk8kehkjAWmB8xe9). The questionnaire is a short survey on users' usage and wants of annotation for text and/or image processing for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

This summary is based on the results collated on 30 June 2020. We may update the results if there are significant no. of new responses after the stipulate dated in the previous sentence. 

 
#  Population 

 - There are 78 responses to the questionnaire. 
 - **94.9% need _annotations_** for their work
 - **80.8% have used an _annotation platform_** before

# Annotations Requirements


## Why do you need annotations for your task/data?


![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMa1QOjA4b45HvT3FKnRnfsgIpgjtjOb7RzJ8ZODJZ1vZr0ImtQ313CdAxcnSi3tXcHiXcXc-oUEoC/pubchart?oid=1144655843&format=image)

 - **65.3% (of 78 respondents) can't find existing open datasets** that fit their needs
 - **53.8% (of 78 respondents) stated that there is no data in the domain** they're interested in
 - **47.4% (of 78 respondents) wants to explore new facet of data/task** that requires new annotations

 - **Others** reasons includes:
   - Data for low-resource languages doesn't exist (e.g. marginalised and indigenous langauges)
   - Security/privacy reason
   - Developing new annotation methods
   - Available data size is insufficient for specific phenomena / task
   - Data for biomedical data is inadequate/insufficient
   - Academic datasets and pre-trained models are unusable on real data
   - "We build datasets in my lab"
  

## What NLP tasks do you need annotation for?

 - **75.6% (of 78 respondents) need Classification** annotations
 - **60.0% (of 78 respondents) need Span** annotations**
 - **38.5% (of 78 respondents) need Entity Linking** annotations

 - **Others** annotation includes:
    - Video captioning (3 out of 78 respondents)
    - Bounding boxes (2 out of 78 respondents)
    - Word level annotation (includes correction of word tokens)
    - Sentiment / Emotions annotation
    - Stance annotation 
    - NER annotation
    - Writing paraphrases / Dialog systems
    - MCQ answering
    - Item/Product relevancy scoring
    - Semantic Role Labeling
    - Open Information Extraction
    
## Would the annotations you need require domain expertise or can it be handled by crowdsource workers with some minimum requirements?

![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMa1QOjA4b45HvT3FKnRnfsgIpgjtjOb7RzJ8ZODJZ1vZr0ImtQ313CdAxcnSi3tXcHiXcXc-oUEoC/pubchart?oid=2081029176&format=image)

## Do you have a pool of trusted/expert annotators that can work on your annotation task(s)?

![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMa1QOjA4b45HvT3FKnRnfsgIpgjtjOb7RzJ8ZODJZ1vZr0ImtQ313CdAxcnSi3tXcHiXcXc-oUEoC/pubchart?oid=1814184526&format=image)

 - **Others** comments includes:
   - Had some trusted annotators for last project. Would have to train a new team the next time.
   - Often, it is the researchers who want to use the annotations for a specific task annotating the data.
   - Kind of - I train university students to annotate as needed for specific projects.
   - Somtimes.
   - I don't really know.
   - Can't say we have trusted or expert annotators but we have annotators.

# Open Source Annotation Platforms

## Have you used open source / commercial annotation platforms before?

![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTMa1QOjA4b45HvT3FKnRnfsgIpgjtjOb7RzJ8ZODJZ1vZr0ImtQ313CdAxcnSi3tXcHiXcXc-oUEoC/pubchart?oid=851618670&format=image)

 - 79.7% (63 of 78 respondents) **have** used open source annotation platforms before

The keywords **flexibility** and **ease**/**easy**/**simple** appears in many of the comments to list the top features for annotation platform. We suggest the following for annotation tools creators to accomodate these feedbacks:

 - Customizable tasks / labels / schema setup and output formats for annotation project managers
 - User-friendly and intuitive UI/UX 
 - Customizable shortcuts and/or mobile-friendly features to help annotators 

Another recurring theme in the top feature list includes:

 - Respondents highlighting ability to annotate (i) overlapping spans, (ii) discontinuous spans, (iii) corrections to initial tokenizations (iv) entity relation annotations
 - In cases where free text annotation is allowed, some sort of respondents highlighted **need for constraints/limitations of free text**
